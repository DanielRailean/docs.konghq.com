## 2.3.3.4
**Release Date** 2021/09/02

### Fixes

#### Enterprise
- This release fixes a regression in the Kong Dev Portal templates that removed dynamic menu navigation and other improvements
from portals created in Kong Gateway v2.3.3.3.

## 2.3.3.3
**Release Date** 2021/08/18

### Fixes

#### Enterprise
- Users can now successfully delete workspaces after deleting all entities associated with that workspace.
  Previously, Kong Gateway was not correctly cleaning up parent-child relationships. For example, creating
  an Admin also creates a Consumer and RBAC user. When deleting the Admin, the Consumer and RBAC user are
  also deleted, but accessing the `/workspaces/workspace_name/meta` endpoint would show counts for Consumers
  and RBAC users, which prevented the workspace from being deleted. Now deleting entities correctly updates
  the counts, allowing an empty workspace to be deleted.
- Updates Kong Dev Portal templates' JQuery dependency to v3.6.0, improving security.
- Users can now include special characters ".", "-", "_", "~" in workspace names. Before when users created
  workspaces using the UI, the workspace name was validated; however, when using the Admin API to add users,
  the workspace name was not validated. Because the name was not validated in the Admin Api, users could create workspace names with special characters that would then break the environment.
- Kong Gateway now escapes "-" and "." special characters in workspace names when building the compiled pattern
  for collision detection.

#### Plugins
- [OpenID Connect](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect) (`openid-connect`)
  With this fix, when the OpenID Connect plugin is configured with a `config.anonymous` consumer and
  `config.scopes_required` is set, a token missing the required scopes will have the anonymous consumer
  headers set when sent to the upstream.

#### Hybrid Mode
- Control planes are now more lenient when checking data planes' compatibility in hybrid mode. See the
  [Version compatibility](/enterprise/2.3.x/deployment/hybrid-mode/#version-compatibility)
  section of the Hybrid Mode guide for more information. [#7488](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/7488)

## 2.3.3.2
**Release Date** 2021/04/21

### Fixes

#### Enterprise
- When using Kong Gateway in hybrid mode, schema, minor, and major version changes lead to
  a broken connection between the control planes and data planes. With this fix, the
  [OAuth 2.0 Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/oauth2) plugin is upgraded to v2.2.0 and the
  [OpenID Connect](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect) plugin is downgraded from v1.9.0 to v1.8.4.

- When using the [Mutual TLS Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/mtls-auth) plugin with a service
  that was configured for mutual TLS, the Kong Gateway was not sending the client certificate
  to the upstream. With this fix, Kong Gateway now avoids patching a plugin's handler if it is
  not defined and supports client certificates in `buffered_proxying` mode.

## 2.3.3.1
**Release Date** 2021/04/14

### Features

#### Enterprise
- Users can now set a custom login message and classification banner (top and bottom) on the Kong Manager login page.
  This classification banner persists beyond the login page and can be configured in the `kong.conf` file.

  The following new configuration options are now available:
  * `admin_gui_header_txt`
  * `admin_gui_header_bg_color`
  * `admin_gui_header_txt_color`
  * `admin_gui_footer_txt`
  * `admin_gui_footer_bg_color`
  * `admin_gui_footer_txt_color`
  * `admin_gui_login_banner_title`
  * `admin_gui_login_banner_body`

  See the [Kong Manager section](/enterprise/2.3.x/property-reference/#kong-manager-section) of the
  Configuration Property Reference for more information.

### Fixes

#### Core
- Fixed an issue that occurred when using upstreams for load balancing, where Kong was attempting to resolve
the upstream name instead of the hostname and failing with the errors `name resolution failed` and
`dns server error: 3 name error`. The following updates correct the issue:
  - Kong does not cache empty upstream name dictionaries. [7002](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/7002)
  - Kong does not assume upstreams don't exist after init phases. [7010](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/7010)

#### Enterprise
- Fixed an issue with upgrades of Kong Gateway (Enterprise) from v1.5.x to v2.1.x. Before the fix, when admin
  consumers were shared across multiple workspaces, it was possible for the migration to fail. The upgrade would
  fail because plugin entities that depend on consumer entities must live in the same workspace as the consumer entity.
  This fix migrates these plugin entities to the same workspace as the consumer entities. Customers affected by this
  issue will need to upgrade their v2.1 install to at least v2.1.4.5 before attempting to migrate from v1.5 to v2.1.
- Fixed an issue where customers could not add roles to new admin users via Kong Manager. With this fix, role selection
  now properly displays available roles to assign.

#### Plugins
- [Exit Transformer](/hub/kong-inc/exit-transformer) (`exit-transformer`)
  - Fixed an issue where the plugin was running the exit hook twice. It now correctly runs the exit hook once.

## 2.3.3.0
**Release Date** 2021/03/26

### Features

#### Plugins
- [Request Validator](/hub/kong-inc/request-validator) (`request-validator`)
  - Content-type failures are now reported as such when `verbose_response` is enabled.
- [Rate Limiting Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced)
  - Disallows decimal values between 0,1 in `sync_rate`.

### Fixes
- Adjusted the `systemd reload` command to do a `kong prepare`.
- Removed output messages from non-strict failure builds on license validation module.
- Fixed an FFI table overflow issue when syncing DB-less declarative config.
- Kong now accepts values for Subject Alternate Name (SAN) in a certificate as per RFC 5280.
The [Mutual TLS Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/mtls-auth) plugin is now processing presented Alternate Names.
- Fixed a Websocket issue where connection upgrades would fail with a 502 after upgrading to v2.3.2.0.
- Upgrade header is not cleared anymore when response Connection header contains Upgrade.
- Avoided potential race conditions that could result in HTTP 500 errors when using the
least-connection algorithm in the case where an upstream target becomes inaccessible.
- Kong does not try to warm up upstream names when warming up DNS entries.
- Migrations order is now guaranteed to be always the same.
- Buffered responses are disabled on connection upgrades.
- Schema validations now log more descriptive error messages when types are invalid.
- Kong now ignores tags in Cassandra when filtering by multiple entities, which is the expected
behavior and the one already existent when using PostgreSQL databases
- Kong accepts fully-qualified domain names ending in dots.
- Now Kong does not leave plugin servers alive after exiting and does not try to start
them in the unsupported stream subsystem.
- Changed default values and validation rules for plugins that were not well-adjusted
for DB-less or hybrid modes.
- Topological sort now prioritizes core, avoiding problems when plugin entities use
core entities but don't explicitly depend on them.

#### Plugins
- [OpenID Connect](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect) (`openid-connect`)
  - Add `config.disable_session` to be able to disable session creation with
    specified authentication methods.
  - Changed `Cache-Control="no-store"` instead of `Cache-Control="no-cache, no-store"`,
    and only set `Pragma="no-cache"` with HTTP 1.0 (and below).
  - Fixed `/openid-connect/jwks` to not expose private keys (this bug was introduced
    in v1.6.0 (Kong Enterprise v2.1.3.1) and affects all versions up to v1.8.3 (Kong Enterprise v2.3.2)).
  - Token introspection now checks the status code properly.
  - More consistent response body checks on HTTP requests.
  - Fixed an issue where enabling zlib compressor did not affect the size of the session cookie.
- [Rate Limiting Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced) (`rate-limiting-advanced`)
  - Now the plugin does not pre-create namespaces on `init-worker`. As a side effect to this patch
    the plugin will create namespaces on the fly. This may result in a slightly (10-20%) increased
    response time on the first request.
- [Request Validator](/hub/kong-inc/request-validator) (`request-validator`)
  - Now the plugin correctly decodes and normalizes arrays when there are multiple headers with
    the same field-name.
- [Mutual TLS Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/mtls-auth) (`mtls-auth`)
  - Remove CA existence check on plugin creation - the check was not compatible with DB-less mode.
  - Correctly fetch certificates from the end of the proof chain when consumer credentials are used.
- [AWS Lambda](/hub/kong-inc/aws-lambda) (`aws-lambda`)
  - The plugin now respects `skip_large_bodies` config setting when using AWS API Gateway compatibility.
- [ACME](/hub/kong-inc/acme) (`acme`)
  - Bump `lua-resty-acme` to v0.6.x; this fixes several issues with Pebble test server.
- [OAuth 2.0 Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/oauth2) (`oauth2`)
  - The plugin now has better handling for multiple cases of client invalid token generation.

## 2.3.2.0
**Release Date** 2021/02/11

### **Kong Gateway (Enterprise)**
The following sections list {{site.ee_product_name}}-exclusive updates,
features, and fixes for the **2.3.2.0** version.

Kong Enterprise is renamed to Kong Gateway or Kong Gateway (Enterprise) going forward. For a more detailed explanation, including information about Kong Gateway (OSS), see [Kong Gateway (Enterprise) 2.3.x Release Notes](https://docs.konghq.com/enterprise/2.3.x/release-notes/).

### Features

#### Enterprise
- Kong Gateway can now run in free mode, without a license, which gives users access to
Kong Manager and an easy upgrade path to Enterprise.
- A (non-OSS) Kong Gateway running in its default free Mode can be upgraded to add
Enterprise functionality modules and features including **Kong Vitals**, **RBAC**,
**Workspaces**, and **Enterprise Plugins** simply by applying a new Kong license.
Contact your Kong sales representative for more information.
- A new Admin API endpoint allows application of a license to Kong Gateway.
- In hybrid mode, the control plane now propagates its license to the connected data planes in the cluster. Data planes do not require individual licenses.
- The Kong Gateway installation packages now reside under https://bintray.com/kong/ and do not require a login. Search for “gateway” to list all available packages.
- Added details to the error message of the entity type and number of entities that are preventing a Workspace from being deleted if the Workspace is not empty.
- mTLS connections to PostgreSQL are now supported.
- PostgreSQL connection using scram-sha256 authentication are now supported.

#### Core
- Kong checks version compatibility between the control plane and any data planes to ensure
the data planes and any plugins have compatibility with the control plane in hybrid mode.
The sync is stopped if the major/minor version differ or if the installed plugin versions
differ between control plane and data plane nodes. For more information, see
[Version and Compatibility Checks](/2.3.x/hybrid-mode/#version-and-compatibility-checks).
- {{site.base_gateway}} now accepts UTF-8 characters in route and service names. Entities with a `name` field
now support UTF-8 characters.
- Certificates now have `cert_alt` and `key_alt` fields to specify an alternative certificate
and key pair.
- The Go pluginserver `stderr` and `stdout` are now written into {{site.base_gateway}}’s logs, allowing Golang’s
native `log.Printf()`.
  - Introduced support for multiple pluginservers. This feature is backward-compatible with
  the existing single Go pluginserver.

#### Plugin Development Kit (PDK)
- Introduced a `kong.node.get_hostname` method that returns current node's host name.
- Introduced a `kong.cluster.get_id` method that returns a unique ID
  for the current {{site.base_gateway}} cluster. If the gateway is running in DB-less mode
  without a cluster ID explicitly defined, this method returns nil.
  For Hybrid mode, all Control Planes and Data Planes belonging to the
  same cluster returns the same cluster ID. For traditional database
  type deployments, all {{site.base_gateway}} nodes pointing to the same database will
  also return the same cluster ID.
- Introduced a `kong.log.set_serialize_value`, which allows customizing
  the output of `kong.log.serialize`.

#### Plugins
- The [HTTP Log](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/http-log/) (`http-log`) plugin
now lets you add a table of headers to the HTTP request using the
`headers` configuration parameter, which will help you integrate with many observability systems.
- The [Key Authentication](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/) (`key-auth`)
plugin has two new configuration parameters: `key_in_header` and `key_in_query`. Both
are booleans and tell {{site.base_gateway}} whether to accept (true) or reject (false) passed in either
the header or the query string. Both default to “true.”
- The [Request Size Limiting](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/request-size-limiting/)
(`request-size-limiting`) plugin has a new configuration `require_content_length` that
causes the plugin to ensure a valid Content-Length header exists before reading the request body.
- The [Serverless Functions](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/serverless-functions/)
(`serverless-functions`) plugin introduces a sandboxing capability, is *enabled* by default,
and where only Kong PDK, OpenResty `ngx` APIs, and Lua standard libraries are allowed.
- The [LDAP Authentication Advanced](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/ldap-auth-advanced/) (`ldap-auth-advanced`) plugin has two new features:
  - added config `log_search_results` that allows displaying all of the LDAP search results received from the LDAP server.
  - additional debug log statements added for authenticated groups.
- [Rate Limiting Advanced](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced/) (`rate-limiting-advanced`) plugin has added a jitter (random delay) for the Retry-After header.
- [Mutual TLS Authentication](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/mtls-auth/)(`mtls-auth`) plugin has added support for tags in the DAO and now ensures the existence of any provided CAs when creating the plugin entry.
- [Response Transformer Advanced](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/response-transformer-advanced/) (`response-transformer-advanced`) has json paths for nested elements and arrays and transform gzipped content.
- Collector (`collector`, used for Immunity) plugin supports hybrid mode and has removed the `log_bodies` configuration option.
- OpenID Connect Library
  - Token introspection now checks the status code properly.
  - More consistent response body checks on HTTP requests.

#### Configuration
- `client_max_body_size` and `client_body_buffer_size`, that previously
  hardcoded to 10m, are now configurable through
  [nginx_admin_client_max_body_size](/gateway-oss/2.3.x/configuration/#nginx_http_client_max_body_size)
  and [nginx_admin_client_body_buffer_size](/gateway-oss/2.3.x/configuration/#nginx_admin_client_body_buffer_size).
- Kong-generated SSL private keys now have `600` file system permission.
- Properties `ssl_cert`, `ssl_cert_key`, `admin_ssl_cert`,
  `admin_ssl_cert_key`, `status_ssl_cert`, and `status_ssl_cert_key`
  is now an array: previously, only an RSA certificate was generated
  by default; with this change, an ECDSA is also generated. On
  intermediate and modern cipher suites, the ECDSA certificate is set
  as the default fallback certificate; on old cipher suite, the RSA
  certificate remains as the default. On custom certificates, the first
  certificate specified in the array is used.
- {{site.base_gateway}} now runs as a `kong` user if it exists; if user does not exist
  in the system, the `nobody` user is used, as before.

### Dependencies
- Bumped `kong-plugin-serverless-functions` from 1.0 to 2.1.
- Bumped `lua-resty-dns-client` from 5.1.0 to 5.2.0.
- Bumped `lua-resty-healthcheck` from 1.3.0 to 1.4.0.
- Bumped `OpenSSL` from 1.1.1h to 1.1.1i.
- Bumped `kong-plugin-zipkin` from 1.1 to 1.2.
- Bumped `kong-plugin-request-transformer` from 1.2 to 1.3.

### Fixes

#### Core
- Fixed an issue where certain incoming URI may make it possible to bypass security rules applied
on Route objects. This fix make such attacks more difficult by always normalizing the incoming
request's URI before matching against the Router.
- Fixed issue where a Go plugin would fail to read `kong.ctx.shared` values set by Lua plugins.
- Properly trigger `dao:delete_by:post` hook.
- Fixed issue where a route that supports both http and https (and has a hosts and SNIs
match criteria) would fail to proxy http requests, as it does not contain an SNI.
- Fixed issue where a `nil` request context would lead to errors `attempt to index local 'ctx'`
being shown in the logs.
- Reduced the number of needed timers to active health check upstreams and to resolve hosts.
- Schemas for full-schema validations are correctly cached now, avoiding memory
  leaks when reloading declarative configurations.
- The schema for the upstream entities now limits the highest configurable
  number of successes and failures to 255, respecting the limits imposed by
  `lua-resty-healthcheck`.
- Certificates for database connections now are loaded in the right order
  avoiding failures to connect to PostgreSQL databases.
- Fixed Lua `validate_function` in sandbox module.
- Mark boolean fields with default values as required.

#### Enterprise
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly enforced plugins when they exist in the default and a named workspace.
   The plugin configuration in the default workspace was incorrectly overriding the disabled plugin
   configuration in the named workspace.
- Fixed an issue for vitals when proxy-cached-advanced or forward-proxy plugins (possibly others)
are in use.
- Requests that received a cache hit using the plugins were not showing up under
   service/route vitals, but were visible under workspace vitals.

#### CLI
- Fixed issue where `kong reload -c <config>` would fail.
- Fixed issue where the {{site.base_gateway}} configuration cache would get corrupted.
- Kong migrations now accepts a `-p/--prefix` flag.

#### Developer Portal
- Fixed issue when applying permissions to developers using the Application Registration feature.

#### Plugin Development Kit (PDK)
- Ensure the log serializer encodes the `tries` field as an array when
  empty, rather than an object.

#### Plugins
- The [JWT](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/jwt/) (`jwt`) plugin disallows on consumers.
- The [Request Transformer](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer/) (`request-transformer`)
plugin does not allow `null` in config anymore as they can lead to runtime errors.
- [OpenID Connect](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/) (`openid-connect`)
 - Fixed issue causing a 500 auth error when falling back to an anonymous user.
 - Fixed consumer and discovery invalidation events that were returning when the operation was create. This could leave some cache entries in cache that need to be invalidated.
 - Fixed a circular dependency issue with redirect function.
 - Fixed init worker on clients could take a long time.
- The [Rate Limiting](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/) (`rate-limiting`) has improved counter accuracy.

### Deprecated

#### Kong Studio
- Kong Studio is deprecated.

#### Distributions
- Support for CentOS-6 is removed and entered end-of-life on Nov 30, 2020.

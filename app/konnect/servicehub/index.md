The Service Hub makes internal APIs discoverable, consumable, and reusable for internal development teams. Catalog all your services through the Service Hub to create a single source of truth for your organization’s service inventory. By leveraging Service Hub, your application developers can search, discover, and consume existing services to accelerate their time-to-market, while enabling a more consistent end-user experience across the organization’s applications.
